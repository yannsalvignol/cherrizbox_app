### Very Long Messages
```
"Hey! So I've been following you for about 2 years now and I absolutely love your content. You've really inspired me to make some major changes in my life. I started going to the gym regularly about 8 months ago and I've been trying to eat healthier too. I've lost about 15 pounds so far which I'm pretty happy about but I feel like my progress has slowed down a lot recently. I'm currently doing a push/pull/legs split 6 days a week and I try to do some cardio 3-4 times per week usually on the treadmill or elliptical for about 30 minutes. My diet is pretty good I think - I eat a lot of chicken, rice, vegetables, and I try to hit my protein goals every day. I use MyFitnessPal to track everything and I'm eating about 1800 calories per day. I'm 5'8 and currently weigh about 165 pounds. My goal is to get down to about 155 and then maybe start focusing more on building muscle. But lately I've been feeling really tired and my workouts don't feel as good as they used to. I'm wondering if I should take a diet break or maybe change up my workout routine? Also I've been thinking about hiring a personal trainer but they're pretty expensive and I'm not sure if it's worth it. What do you think I should do? Also, what supplements do you recommend? I'm currently only taking a basic whey protein powder but I've been thinking about adding creatine and maybe a pre-workout. Oh and one more thing - how important is meal timing? I usually eat breakfast around 7am, lunch at noon, and dinner around 7pm with a post-workout shake sometime in the afternoon. Is this okay or should I be eating more frequently? Sorry for the long message, I just have so many questions and you're the only person I trust for advice!"
